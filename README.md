# Seshat’s Organic Diamond Composites (ODC)

Next-Generation Sustainable, High-Performance Materials

## About the Project

Seshat’s Organic Diamond Composites (ODC) combine **hemp-derived carbon nanosheets (HDCNS)** with **organic epoxies** to create ultra-strong, sustainable composites. These composites are designed to provide a **biodegradable, high-strength alternative** to traditional fossil-fuel-based materials. ODC is suitable for a variety of industries, including **aerospace**, **automotive**, **construction**, and **defense**. 

This project offers an innovative solution for creating materials that outperform conventional synthetics while supporting a transition to a more sustainable, eco-friendly future.

## Key Features & Benefits

- **Hemp-Derived Carbon Nanosheets (HDCNS)**: These carbon nanosheets offer exceptional strength, flexibility, and conductivity.
- **Sustainable Composition**: 100% organic, biodegradable, and free from fossil fuels.
- **Versatile Applications**: Ideal for industries such as aerospace, automotive, construction, defense, and renewable energy.
- **Eco-Friendly**: Reduces reliance on petrochemical-based composites, contributing to a circular economy.
- **High Performance**: Outperforms traditional materials in terms of strength-to-weight ratio, durability, and thermal conductivity.

## Composition

- **Hemp Nanosheets (HDCNS)**: Act as the main reinforcement, providing strength and durability.
- **Hemp Oil**: Used as a binder, enhancing the flexibility and cohesion of the composite material.
- **Hemp Lignin**: Acts as a curing agent, improving the mechanical properties and durability of the material.
