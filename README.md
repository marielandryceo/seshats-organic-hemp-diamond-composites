Seshat’s Organic Diamond Composites
Pioneering the Future of Sustainable, High-Performance Materials

About the Project
Seshat’s Organic Diamond Composites (ODC) is revolutionizing advanced materials by harnessing hemp-derived carbon nanosheets (HDCNS) and organic epoxies to create sustainable, ultra-strong composites. Designed to outperform traditional fossil-fuel-based materials, ODC offers a biodegradable, high-strength alternative for aerospace, automotive, construction, defense, and beyond.

This project is a key innovation of Diamond Composites, aligning with the Organic Revolution of 2030 and the mission to transition global industries toward sustainable, organic-certified materials.
