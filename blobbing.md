# Instructions for Creating Physical Prototypes ("Blobs") of Seshat's Organic Diamond Composites

This document outlines the procedures for fabricating the initial physical prototypes, referred to as "blobs," of Seshat's Organic Diamond Composites. These composites are designed by Marie Seshat Landry to combine hemp-derived carbon nanosheets (HDCNS) with hemp-based epoxy resin, aiming to create materials with exceptional strength and environmental compatibility.

## 1. Preparation of Hemp-Derived Carbon Nanosheets (HDCNS)

**Materials Needed:**

- Hemp biomass (e.g., hemp hurd or stalks)
- Deionized water
- Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
- Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
- Nitrogen gas (N₂)
- Furnace capable of reaching 180°C

**Procedure:**

1. **Material Selection:** Choose high-quality hemp biomass free from contaminants.
2. **Hydrothermal Carbonization:**
   - Combine the hemp biomass with deionized water in a suitable reactor.
   - Heat the mixture to 180°C under pressure for 4 hours to facilitate carbonization.
   - After cooling, filter and wash the resulting hydrochar with deionized water to remove soluble impurities.
3. **Activation:**
   - Treat the hydrochar with a dilute hydrochloric acid solution to eliminate inorganic impurities.
   - Neutralize the acid-treated hydrochar with sodium hydroxide solution.
   - Dry the neutralized hydrochar under nitrogen gas flow at 100°C for 12 hours to obtain HDCNS.

*Note: Ensure all procedures are conducted in a well-ventilated fume hood with appropriate personal protective equipment.*

## 2. Synthesis of Hemp-Based Epoxy Resin

**Materials Needed:**

- Hemp seed oil
- Epichlorohydrin
- Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
- Benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BEAC)
- Acetone
- Anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄)

**Procedure:**

1. **Extraction of Hemp Oil:**
   - Cold-press hemp seeds to extract hemp seed oil.
   - Filter the oil to remove solid particles.
2. **Epoxidation:**
   - React the hemp seed oil with epichlorohydrin in the presence of sodium hydroxide to form a glycerol-based epoxy resin.
   - Purify the epoxy resin by washing with acetone and drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.

*Note: Handle all chemicals with care, following standard laboratory safety protocols.*

## 3. Composite Fabrication

**Materials Needed:**

- Prepared HDCNS
- Hemp-based epoxy resin
- Hardener (e.g., polyamine)
- Molds with desired dimensions
- Vacuum degassing chamber

**Procedure:**

1. **Composite Preparation:**
   - Disperse HDCNS in the hemp-based epoxy resin using ultrasonication to achieve a uniform suspension.
   - Mix the hardener with the resin-HDCNS mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. **Molding:**
   - Pour the composite mixture into molds, ensuring no air bubbles remain.
   - Use a vacuum degassing chamber to remove entrained air.
3. **Curing:**
   - Cure the filled molds in an oven at 120°C for 2 hours.
   - Allow the composites to cool to room temperature before demolding.

*Note: Ensure molds are properly sealed to prevent leakage during curing.*

## 4. Characterization and Testing

**Materials Needed:**

- Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
- Universal testing machine
- Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA)

**Procedure:**

1. **Structural Analysis:**
   - Use SEM to examine the surface morphology and dispersion of HDCNS within the composite.
2. **Mechanical Testing:**
   - Perform tensile and flexural tests using a universal testing machine to assess mechanical properties.
3. **Thermal Stability:**
   - Analyze the thermal stability of the composites using TGA under a nitrogen atmosphere.

*Note: Calibration of testing equipment should be performed regularly to ensure accurate measurements.*

## Safety Considerations

- Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including gloves, safety glasses, and lab coats.
- Conduct all procedures involving chemicals and high temperatures in a well-ventilated fume hood.
- Be familiar with the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all chemicals used.
- Dispose of all waste materials according to local environmental and safety regulations.

**Disclaimer:** These instructions are provided as a general guide. Users should adapt procedures based on specific laboratory conditions and comply with all applicable safety and regulatory standards.
