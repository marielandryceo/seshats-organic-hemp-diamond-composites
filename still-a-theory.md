# Seshat's Organic Diamond Composites: Conceptual Stage

Seshat's Organic Diamond Composites, envisioned by Marie Seshat Landry, represent a novel approach to sustainable materials science. These composites are proposed to combine hemp-derived carbon nanosheets (HDCNS) with hemp-based epoxies, aiming to create materials with exceptional strength and environmental compatibility. The conceptual framework suggests that integrating these components could lead to innovative applications across various industries.

- **Research and Development:** The foundational research draws upon the work of Dr. David Mitlin, who discovered hemp-derived carbon nanosheets suitable for supercapacitors. While Dr. Mitlin's research is limited to energy storage applications, the extrapolation of these materials to composite development is a new direction proposed by Marie Seshat Landry.
