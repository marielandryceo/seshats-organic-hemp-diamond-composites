# Formulation of Seshat’s Organic Diamond Composites (ODC)

## Overview
Seshat’s Organic Diamond Composites (ODC) are created using 100% **organic hemp-derived components**. The primary ingredients include **hemp nanosheets**, **hemp oil**, and **hemp lignin**, each contributing essential properties to the final composite material. This formulation aims to provide a sustainable, high-strength, and biodegradable alternative to synthetic composites.

## Core Components

### 1. **Hemp Nanosheets (HDCNS)**
   - **Function**: The nanosheets serve as the primary reinforcing agent within the composite material, providing **high strength**, **flexibility**, and **conductivity**.
   - **Properties**:
     - High aspect ratio (length to width)
     - Enhanced mechanical strength
     - Lightweight but durable
   - **Preparation**: The nanosheets are extracted from **hemp fibers** using mechanical exfoliation techniques and then processed into thin, uniform sheets.

### 2. **Hemp Oil (Ho)**
   - **Function**: Acts as the **binder** and **plasticizer**, ensuring proper dispersion of the nanosheets and enhancing the **plasticity** and **flexibility** of the composite.
   - **Properties**:
     - Acts as an environmentally friendly resin
     - Biodegradable and non-toxic
     - Contributes to enhanced **thermoplastic behavior** when exposed to heat
   - **Usage**: Hemp oil is mixed with the hemp nanosheets to create a uniform slurry that can be molded or extruded into desired forms.

### 3. **Hemp Lignin**
   - **Function**: Serves as the **curing agent** for the composite, promoting crosslinking and increasing **thermal stability** and **durability**.
   - **Properties**:
     - High chemical resistance
     - Contributes to **higher rigidity** and **density** of the composite
     - Sustainable and derived from hemp waste by-products
   - **Usage**: Hemp lignin is added in controlled amounts to activate the curing process and solidify the composite matrix.

## Mixing Ratios

### Basic Formulation:
The following is a general guideline for mixing the ingredients:
- **Hemp Nanosheets (HDCNS)**: 60-70% by weight
- **Hemp Oil (Ho)**: 20-30% by weight
- **Hemp Lignin**: 10-15% by weight

### Adjustments:
- **For increased strength**: Increase the proportion of **Hemp Nanosheets**.
- **For increased flexibility**: Increase the proportion of **Hemp Oil**.
- **For faster curing time**: Adjust the **Hemp Lignin** content.

## Processing Method:
1. **Step 1**: Prepare the hemp nanosheets by mechanical exfoliation.
2. **Step 2**: Mix hemp oil into the nanosheets to create a homogeneous slurry.
3. **Step 3**: Add hemp lignin to the mixture and stir until fully integrated.
4. **Step 4**: Pour the composite slurry into molds or use extrusion techniques to form desired shapes.
5. **Step 5**: Cure the material by applying heat and pressure, allowing the hemp lignin to crosslink and harden the composite.
6. **Step 6**: Allow the composite to cool and solidify before testing or further processing.

## Conclusion:
This formulation offers a **100% organic**, **biodegradable**, and **high-performance material** suitable for a wide range of applications in various industries, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional materials while maintaining exceptional performance characteristics.
