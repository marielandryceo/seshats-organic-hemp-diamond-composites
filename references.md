## Dr. David Mitlin's Discovery of Hemp-Derived Carbon Nanosheets

Dr. David Mitlin and his research team pioneered the development of carbon nanosheets derived from hemp bast fibers. Their work demonstrated that these nanosheets possess exceptional properties suitable for energy storage applications, particularly in supercapacitors. Key findings from their research include:

1. **Ultrafast Supercapacitors**: The hemp-derived carbon nanosheets exhibit high specific surface areas and excellent electrical conductivity, making them ideal for ultrafast supercapacitor applications. At temperatures ranging from 0 °C to 100 °C, these supercapacitors maintain remarkable capacitance, with specific capacitances of 113 F g⁻¹ at 20 °C and 142 F g⁻¹ at 100 °C.

These advancements highlight the potential of hemp-derived materials in developing sustainable and efficient energy storage solutions.

## Marie Seshat Landry's Development of 100% Organic Hemp Diamond Composites

Building upon Dr. Mitlin's foundational work, Marie Seshat Landry has innovated the creation of "100% Organic Hemp Diamond Composites." These composites are synthesized using hemp-derived carbon nanosheets, hemp lignin, and hemp oil, resulting in materials that are both strong and environmentally friendly. Key aspects of her work include:

1. **Composite Composition**: The Diamond Composites are formulated using a base known as the "Hemp Triforce," which combines organic hemp oil (Ho) as a binding agent, hemp lignin (Hl) for rigidity, and hemp-derived carbon nanosheets for strength and conductivity.
