# Environmental Impact of Seshat’s Organic Diamond Composites

## Carbon Footprint
Hemp-based composites have a significantly lower carbon footprint compared to conventional materials such as carbon fiber and plastics.

## Biodegradability
Unlike synthetic composites, Seshat’s ODCs are fully biodegradable, ensuring that they will not contribute to long-term pollution.
