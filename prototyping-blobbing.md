# Instructions for Creating Physical Prototypes ("Blobs") of Seshat's Organic Diamond Composites

This document outlines the procedures for fabricating the initial physical prototypes, referred to as "blobs," of Seshat's Organic Diamond Composites. These composites are designed by Marie Seshat Landry to combine hemp-derived carbon nanosheets (HDCNS) with hemp-based epoxy resin, aiming to create materials with exceptional strength and environmental compatibility.

## 1. Preparation of Hemp-Derived Carbon Nanosheets (HDCNS)

**Materials Needed:**

- Hemp stalks
- Deionized water
- Concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)
- Nitrogen gas (N₂)
- Hydrothermal reactor

**Procedure:**

1. **Material Selection:**
   - Select mature hemp stalks, ensuring they are free from contaminants and have a high lignin content.

2. **Hydrothermal Carbonization:**
   - Cut the hemp stalks into small pieces (approximately 1 cm in length).
   - Wash the hemp pieces thoroughly with deionized water to remove impurities.
   - Place the washed hemp pieces into a hydrothermal reactor.
   - Add concentrated sulfuric acid to the reactor at a ratio of 1:10 (hemp to acid by weight).
   - Seal the reactor and heat it to 180°C for 12 hours under nitrogen atmosphere to prevent oxidation.
   - After cooling, filter the resulting black slurry and wash the solid residue with deionized water until the pH reaches neutral.
   - Dry the washed material at 60°C for 24 hours to obtain HDCNS powder.

## 2. Synthesis of Hemp-Based Epoxy Resin

**Materials Needed:**

- Hemp oil
- Epichlorohydrin
- Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
- Benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BEA)
- Solvents (e.g., acetone, toluene)

**Procedure:**

1. **Extraction of Hemp Oil:**
   - Cold-press mature hemp seeds to extract hemp oil.
   - Filter the oil to remove solid impurities.

2. **Epoxidation:**
   - Mix the hemp oil with epichlorohydrin in a 1:1 molar ratio.
   - Add sodium hydroxide to the mixture to initiate the reaction.
   - Heat the mixture to 60°C and stir for 6 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere.
   - After cooling, wash the product with acetone to remove unreacted epichlorohydrin.
   - Dry the epoxidized hemp oil under vacuum.

## 3. Composite Fabrication

**Materials Needed:**

- HDCNS powder
- Epoxidized hemp oil
- Curing agent (hemp lignin)
- Solvents (e.g., acetone)
- Molding equipment

**Procedure:**

1. **Composite Preparation:**
   - Dissolve the epoxidized hemp oil in acetone to obtain a 20% (w/v) solution.
   - Disperse HDCNS powder in the oil solution to achieve a uniform suspension.
   - Add hemp lignin to the suspension at a ratio of 5% by weight of the total solids.
   - Stir the mixture thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.

2. **Molding:**
   - Pour the prepared composite mixture into molds of desired shapes and sizes.
   - Remove air bubbles by applying vacuum or using a centrifuge.

3. **Curing:**
   - Place the filled molds in an oven and cure at 120°C for 2 hours.
   - Allow the molded composites to cool to room temperature before demolding.

## 4. Characterization and Testing

**Materials Needed:**

- Universal testing machine
- Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
- Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) equipment

**Procedure:**

1. **Structural Analysis:**
   - Use SEM to examine the surface morphology and dispersion of HDCNS within the composite.

2. **Mechanical Testing:**
   - Perform tensile and flexural tests using a universal testing machine to evaluate the mechanical properties of the composites.

3. **Chemical Analysis:**
   - Conduct FTIR spectroscopy to identify functional groups and confirm the chemical structure of the composites.

## Safety Considerations

- Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, goggles, and lab coats.
- Handle concentrated acids and bases with care, following standard safety protocols.
- Ensure proper ventilation when working with volatile solvents and during curing processes.
- Dispose of chemical waste according to local environmental regulations.

**Note:** These procedures are adapted from existing literature and should be optimized based on specific laboratory conditions and equipment availability. Always consult material safety data sheets (MSDS) for detailed safety information on chemicals used.
